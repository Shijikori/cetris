# Cetris

## About

This project aims to become a tetris clone made in C++ using GLFW.
This software is currently only tested on Arch Linux.

## Requirements

You need the GLFW library and GNU C/C++ Compiler (GCC) installed on your system.

## Build & Run

Launch the script `build.sh` to build the application binary.

Launch the script `run.sh` to build and run the application. The binary will be deleted on exit with this script.

The script `clean.sh` is meant to clean (delete) the compilation files. All that should remain after running this script is the code and vscode settings.
